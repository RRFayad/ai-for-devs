## M01 - Leveraging Github COpilot

### AUtocompletion

- When autocompleting, we can hover over the suggestion, and the number of suggestions

- Also there's the _complete the word_

### nextEdisSuggestion

- Go to settings, turn it on, it will recomend a '2nd step suggestion'
  - E.g.: When I updated a variable name, it suggested to update it also in a comment and in a print message

### Mastering Prompts

- Remember I can write the prompt in a comment

- `cmd+i` opens the chat, and I ahve different options

## Configuring Copilot

- Among the settings, there are 2 Max finds to be particularly interesting:

  - **Use Instruction Files**

    - I can create a file with general guidelines

  - **Temporal Context**
    - Consider the last changes, may be usefiul fpor exampe qhen ccreating an util functions - so it can suggest the import and implementation

- So, the key point is to be aware that those settings exist, and check them sometimes, as they get updated frequently

## Code Actions (Good for asking for review / refactoring)

- Select the code, and the AI sparks will appear
  **Easy way to ask for a review**

## Sidebar for more complex tasks

- Side bar chat for answers besides simply code
  - Also consider the buttons options (apply, compare, etc)

## Adding Context

- Add FIles for context

  - It shows it has the opened files context, but also, we can add files for context
  - I can type # in the prompt

- Other stuff for context: @
  - @vscode - May ask about vscode setting for example
